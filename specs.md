## Bot Functionality

### Main Menu (`/menu` command)

Presents two options:
- **Events list**
- **Contact**

---

### Events List

- When "Events list" is selected, display a button for each event from the `events` table.
- When a user clicks an event button, reply with the corresponding `qtickets_link` for that event.

---

### Contact

- When "Contact" is selected, prompt the user to enter a message.
- The entered message should be sent to all users with the `admin` role, using the template:  
  `"Feedback text from {username}: {text}"`

  You may create new files if necessary.
